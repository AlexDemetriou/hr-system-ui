# HR System Techincal Test React TypeScript Application

Scaffolded using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), and made some optional recommended modifications to enhance ESLint (added react plugins etc).

Installed [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) using [this guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite), as well as some recommended plugins + Libraries for bespoke components.

New Resource form uses Formik and Yup for handling validation and submission. It is pretty helpful for restricting invalid data and actions.
